# PRODIGY_ML_02
This is my second task as a Machine Learning Intern for Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I am entitled to create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
The dataset that is used for this project is also saved as a (.csv) file.
The codes are in the (.ipynb) file that is saved in this repository.
